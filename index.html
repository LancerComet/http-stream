    <h1>HttpStream</h1>
    <div>
      <p>In this example, what we are basiclly doing is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create two `HttpStream`s from both a png image and a jpg image.</li>
        <li>Read thier pixel size without downloading them completely.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please open the console to see what is happening, and remember to check the size of downloaded content in "Network" panel.</p>
